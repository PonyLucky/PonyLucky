Hi I'm @PonyLucky, my name is MARGOT Louis. I'm a french man who loves programmation. What I prefer is Web Development.

I'm working here for my pleasure, as shows the Light-Novel-Saver project I'm just sharing what I made when I think it can be useful for others too.

You can reach me on this email address: louis.margot@viacesi.fr

I don't bite ;)
